.TH SYSCALL 1
.SH NAME
syscall \- Test a system call
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B syscall
[\fB\-o\fR]
.IR entry
.IR arg ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B syscall(1)
is an effort to port the plan9 syscall command to Linux. Not all the system calls are supposed to work since the system call convention on linux is more complex than plan9 but the most trivial ones are already implemented. Instead of relying on the libc implementation of the system calls this program uses the 
.B syscall(2)
library function to invoke the system calls.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-o
Output to stdout the contents of the buffer argument specified as buf.
.TP
.BR \-h
Print a help message and exit.
.SH EXAMPLES
Write a string to standard output:

	syscall write 1 hello 5

Read a string from the standard input and output the buffer contents to stdout:

	syscall -o read 0 buf 3

Get the pid of the current running process:

	syscall getpid

Make a directory:

	syscall -o getcwd buf 100

Exit the program with status 2:

	syscall -o exit 2
